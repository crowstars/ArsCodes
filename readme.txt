Hi! These are programs that can decode the numbers at the end of Ars Paradoxica episodes, and generate the numbers for your own messages. 

Before running, you will need to have Java installed. Sorry, it’s the programming language I know best, but most computers don’t have it installed by default. You can download it here: https://java.com/en/download/ 
Despite appearances/old web design, this is the official and safe Java download link. After that, go ahead and download the .jar file, and then just double click on the .jar file to run!

I will be posting updates to this program on the Twitter account @ArsDecoder, and on Tumblr at www.arsdecoder.tumblr.com. I had a lot of fun figuring out the Ars Paradoxica codes, and I want to let as many other people as I can have a similar experience. Therefore, my hope is that I can retain some semblance of control over the distribution of this program, so that it can mainly be a tool for fellow codebreakers, and for a few folks who have absolutely no intention of deciphering the codes themselves. Thanks.
