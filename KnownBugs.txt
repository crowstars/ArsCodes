List of known issues that I am aware of and working on:

- Window moves back to center of screen when it resizes itself

- Window automatically resizes itself to default when elements are hidden/become visible even if window has been manually resized and is large enough to contain all of them

- Decoder does not decode or print error message when numbers field contains punctuation

- Despite running fine, program throws exceptions in console of IDE
