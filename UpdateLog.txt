Ok so I had to completely rewrite how the program works in order to implement the second/combination color, and uh I'm the boss of this so I'm calling it version 2. It behaves pretty much like version 1 did, but a lot of the code is different. Plus, it can do combination colors now. Still have a couple tweaks I want to work out, mainly just efficiency stuff, so I'll probably be updating it again soon.

Now prints error message if numbers field contains any letters or punctuation other than "|" character. Fixed bug where window could expand past screen edges.

Fixed bug where if encoded numbers were too long, window would expand past screen edges.

11/16/17 3:41 PM - Decoder Version 1.1.1
Fixed bug where if numbers field had punctuation, it wouldn't decode or show an error message. Now shows an error message, eventually I might try to get it to put the punctuation back in after decoding.

Now decodes with Market values. Time and Market fields now hidden unless selected. Window now resizes automatically so that all components are visible. Decoded text can now be copied to clipboard.

Small changes to make the program more efficient. Realistically, this is not a noticable difference. It's not processing enough data to be visible, but the run time is decreased by a few microseconds. Realistically, I'm procrastinating my homework.
